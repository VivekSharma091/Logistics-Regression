        "\n",
        "* Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to study the relationship between two continuous variables — one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "It helps us understand how the dependent variable changes when the independent variable changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The relationship between X and Y is represented by a straight line, called the regression line, given by the equation:\n",
        "* **Y=β0​+β1​X+ε**\n",

        "\n",
        "* ε = Error term (difference between actual and predicted values)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "* Suppose we want to predict a student’s marks (Y) based on the number of study hours (X). If the regression equation is\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Marks=20+5×(StudyHours)**\n",
        "\n",
        "* it means that for every 1 extra hour of study, marks increase by 5 on average.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Purpose of Simple Linear Regression:**\n",
        "* The main purposes of SLR are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Prediction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* To predict the value of one variable based on another.\n",

        "* Example: Predict sales based on advertising expenditure.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Understanding Relationships:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* To measure how strongly two variables are related and in which direction (positive or negative).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Trend Analysis:**\n",

        "\n",
        "* Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is based on certain key assumptions to ensure that the model gives accurate and reliable results.\n",
        "If these assumptions are violated, the predictions and interpretations of the model may not be valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **1. Linearity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* There should be a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "\n",
        "* The change in Y should be proportional to the change in X.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Example:**\n",
        "* If study hours increase, marks should increase (or decrease) in a roughly straight-line pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **2. Independence of Errors:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This means that the error made for one observation should not influence the error made for another.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "* In time-series data, this ensures that one observation does not depend on the previous one.\n",

        "* **3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The variance of errors should be constant for all values of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In other words, the spread of residuals should be the same across all predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        "* If the spread increases or decreases, it indicates heteroscedasticity, which violates this assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **4. Normality of Errors:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) should be normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This assumption is mainly important for statistical tests like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **5. No Multicollinearity (for multiple regression):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Although this is more relevant for Multiple Linear Regression, in SLR it implies that:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The independent variable (X) should not be highly correlated with any other variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In SLR, since there is only one X, this assumption is automatically satisfied.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **6. No Autocorrelation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* In case of time-based data, the residuals should not show any pattern or correlation over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "* If errors are correlated (for example, increasing or decreasing in a pattern), the model violates this assumption.\n",

        "* **3. β₀ (Beta Zero) – Intercept:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* It represents the value of Y when X = 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In other words, it is the point where the regression line crosses the Y-axis.\n",
